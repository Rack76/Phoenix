# Phoenix

### Purpose
The aim is to learn how game engines work and the process of building one. The end goal is to be able to create a simple 2D/3D game using the engine. 

### Cloning the repository
Create a directory and run the following command.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ac8736/Phoenix
```

#### Premake
To build the solution files and its configurations, we are using Premake. Run the GenerateProjectFile.bat file to run the Premake script. Premake may be replaced with CMake in the future.

### Dev Log
A dev log website will be posted here in the future to document the process of the game engine. It will serve as a document to show all the resources used and how the decisions of the engine were made.
